The FASTCORMICS workflow uses as input z-scored transformed data obtained by the barcode workflow. 
The bacode package was implemented in R and is regularly updated. 
It is highly advisable to use the latest version of the frma package and the corresponding vector package. 
For more information, read the fastcormics paper (Integrated metabolic modelling reveals cell-type specific epigenetic control points of the macrophage metabolic network)
and the barcode paper (The Gene Expression Barcode: leveraging public data repositories to begin cataloging the human and murine transcriptomes). 
An example of the discretization script is given in this folder. 
Note that you will have to change the vector in function of the platform . 
The vector contains the median and the standard deviation of the unexpressed mode for each gene for a given platform. 
The available vectors as well as the frma can be downloaded from the bioconductor webpage. 

The function removeRxns of the Cobra toolbox and a working IBM cplex installation is required to run this version.
